## paymentspring checkout

My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. My god, they found me. I don't know how but they found me. Run for it, Marty. No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically.

Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. Damn, where is that kid. Damn. Damn damn. You're late, do you have no concept of time? You bet. Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my control watch.


### Example

To include a checkout button on a web page, request a checkout form-id. Once you have a form-id, paste this javascript into your site where you would like the form to appear:

```markdown
<script id="ps-script" src="https://checkout.paymentspring.com/js/paymentspring.js" formid="cb7eae32763131ade35f"></script>
```
Where `cb7eae32763131ade35f` is your form-id.
